      "abstract": "The invention is that of systems and methods for communications between one or more networks and subsequently network devices configured with a networking application for processing network based communications when the devices are on different logical and physical networks. The methods herein involve translation of remote IP addresses of LAN devices to addresses comprising headend network prefixes, to allow for LAN extension of remote to headend networks and communications between devices on the disparate networks. Data packets from a remote LAN interface are transferred to an outbound interface once translated, then forwarded via a formed bridged tunnel link to a headend network device. A server comprising a local LAN and outbound interface is further configured with a NAT module for IP address translation and an optional security module for additional authenticity verification of remote devices attempting to penetrate the headend network.",

The invention comprises a central database where servers within a server group identified by a group name may post unique identifiers (UIDs) for retrieval and reposting by group clients configured with the group name, which may query the central database for server connection information such as uptime, downtime, and congestion in order to select a server for a preferential connection based on an overall posture as determined by the group client. In some embodiments, one server of the group is a \"dummy server\" that may aggregate and selectively transmit server information from other servers in the group, or other devices, and post it to the central database. The methods described herein eliminate a separate controller and thereby a single point of failure (SPOF).",
